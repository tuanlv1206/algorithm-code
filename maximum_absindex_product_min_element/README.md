Given an array of n distinct elements. Find the maximum of product of Minimum of two numbers in the array and absolute difference of their positions, i.e., find maximum value of abs(i â€“ j) * min(arr[i], arr[j]) where i and j vary from 0 to n-1.

Input : arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 4}
Output: 9
// arr[0] = 3 and arr[3] = 4 minimum of them is 3 and
// absolute difference between their position is
// abs(0-3) = 3. So product is 3*3 = 9

Input : arr[] = {8, 1, 9, 4}
Output: 16
// arr[0] = 8 and arr[2] = 9 minimum of them is 8 and
// absolute difference between their position is
// abs(0-2) = 2. So product is 8*2 = 16
