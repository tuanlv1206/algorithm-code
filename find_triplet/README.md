Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers, print all triplets that forms Geometric Progression with integral common ratio.

A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54,â€¦ is a geometric progression with common ratio 3.

Examples:

Input:
arr = [1, 2, 6, 10, 18, 54]
Output:
2 6 18
6 18 54

Input:
arr = [2, 8, 10, 15, 16, 30, 32, 64]
Output:
2 8 32
8 16 32
16 32 64

Input:
arr = [ 1, 2, 6, 18, 36, 54]
Output:
2 6 18
1 6 36
6 18 54
