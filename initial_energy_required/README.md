Given an array containing positive and negative numbers. The array represents checkpoints from one end to other end of street. Positive and negative values represent amount of energy at that checkpoint. Positive numbers increase the energy and negative numbers decrease. Find the minimum initial energy required to cross the street such that Energy level never becomes 0 or less than 0.

Note : The value of minimum initial energy required will be 1 even if we cross street successfully without loosing energy to less than and equal to 0 at any checkpoint. The 1 is required for initial check point.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {4, -10, 4, 4, 4}
Output: 7
Suppose initially we have energy = 0, now at 1st
checkpoint, we get 4. At 2nd checkpoint, energy gets
reduced by -10 so we have 4 + (-10) = -6 but at any
checkpoint value of energy can not less than equals
to 0. So initial energy must be at least 7 because
having 7 as initial energy value at 1st checkpoint
our energy will be = 7+4 = 11 and then we can cross
2nd checkpoint successfully. Now after 2nd checkpoint,
all checkpoint have positive value so we can cross
street successfully with 7 initial energy.

Input : arr[] = {3, 5, 2, 6, 1}
Output: 1
We need at least 1 initial energy to reach first
checkpoint

Input : arr[] = {-1, -5, -9}
Output: 16
